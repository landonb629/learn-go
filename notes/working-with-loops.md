# Looping options in Golang 
- for loop 
- for-each loop
- while loop

## The for loop 
3 parts that make the for-loop 
- initialization 
    - creating a variable and assign a starter value 
    ``` for i := 0; ``` The semi colon is needed
- condition
    ``` for i := 0; i < 10; ``` 
- increment
   ``` for i :=; i < 10; i++ ``` 

## using for-each over a range 
- operate over an array or known sequence 
- foreach iteration you can get the index, and the next item in the loop 

    ### controlling the loop with continue and break 
    - break: exits the loop
