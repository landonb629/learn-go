# Using Variables 

Methods for declaring vars: 
- defining name + type 
- defining a group
- define and assign

## Data types 
- basic types: similar to primitives in JS
- composite types: more complex, arrays, structs, and interfaces 

Declaring variable type 
- explicitly: specifying the type in the declaration
- implicitly: assigning a value which makes it inferred 

## String interpolation 
- use the Printf() function that takes formatters 

What is a formatter? 
- instruction to what a type is 
%s - represents a string 
%d - represents a number 

example 
``` fmt.Printf("Customer %s has %d in their account", customerName, accountBalance) ```
